    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on teaching computers to **learn patterns from data** and **make predictions or decisions** without being explicitly programmed with fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, we provide **examples (data)**, and the algorithm learns the hidden relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example to Understand ML\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traditional programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Rules (explicitly coded) + Data → Output\n",
    "* Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data + Output (examples) → Algorithm learns rules → Predict new output\n",
    "\n",
    "✨ Example: Predicting house prices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input: Size, Location, Number of rooms\n",
    "* Output: House Price\n",

    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn from labeled data (input + correct output given).\n",
    "   * Task: Prediction.\n",
    "   * Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Regression (predict numbers, e.g., house prices).\n",
    "     * Classification (predict categories, e.g., spam vs not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn from unlabeled data (only input, no output given).\n",
    "   * Task: Discover patterns.\n",
    "   * Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Clustering (grouping customers by purchase behavior).\n",
    "     * Dimensionality reduction (compressing features for visualization).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn by interacting with the environment (trial and error).\n",
    "   * Task: Decision making.\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Teaching a robot to walk.\n",
    "     * AlphaGo beating humans in Go.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset** → Collection of examples (features + labels).\n",
    "2. **Model** → Mathematical representation that makes predictions.\n",
    "3. **Training** → Process of learning patterns (adjusting model parameters).\n",
    "4. **Evaluation** → Measuring performance (accuracy, error, etc.).\n",
    "5. **Prediction** → Using the trained model on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is ML important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handles **large, complex data** humans cannot analyze manually.\n",
    "* **Automates tasks** (spam filtering, recommendation systems, fraud detection).\n",
    "* Improves over time as it sees more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning approach Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance-based learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learns by **memorizing training examples**.\n",
    "* No explicit model is built.\n",
    "* Prediction is made by comparing a new instance with stored instances.\n",
    "* Uses a **similarity (distance) measure** to find closest examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)\n",
    "* Locally Weighted Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple, flexible.\n",
    "* Works well if decision boundary is irregular.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expensive at prediction time (must compare with many stored examples).\n",
    "* Sensitive to noise and irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-based learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learns a **general model** from training data.\n",
    "* The model captures underlying relationships, then is used for prediction.\n",
    "* Parameters are estimated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Regression\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Neural Networks\n",
    "* Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast prediction once model is trained.\n",
    "* Generalizes well if model is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training can be computationally heavy.\n",
    "* If model is too simple, it underfits; if too complex, it overfits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instance-based**: “Remember examples, predict by similarity.”\n",
    "* **Model-based**: “Learn rules (parameters), predict by applying model.”\n",
