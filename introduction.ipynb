    "##### A. Target Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Features include data that would only be available *after* the prediction is made.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Predicting if a patient has diabetes.\n",
    "  * Including “insulin prescribed” as a feature.\n",
    "  * Problem: prescription decisions depend on knowing the patient has diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### B. Train-Test Contamination\n",
    "\n",
    "* Test data information accidentally influences training.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scaling or feature selection done **before splitting** dataset into train/test.\n",
    "  * The test data indirectly shapes the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### C. Temporal Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* In time-series data, using **future information** to predict the past.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Predicting stock price at $t$.\n",
    "  * Accidentally including features from $t+1$ or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### D. Indirect / Proxy Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a feature is a disguised form of the target.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Predicting whether a customer churns.\n",
    "  * Including “last month’s customer support ticket closure” → which directly correlates with churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causes of Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing the entire dataset before splitting.\n",
    "* Poor feature engineering (using outcome-related variables).\n",
    "* Mismanaged cross-validation (e.g., same patient’s data across train & test).\n",
    "* Temporal misalignment in time-series datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Healthcare:** Using \"hospital billing code\" as a feature when predicting disease → billing code assigned *after* diagnosis.\n",
    "* **Finance:** Predicting loan defaults using “late payment flag” → this flag only appears after default happens.\n",
    "* **E-commerce:** Predicting purchase likelihood using “discount applied” → but discount decisions happen *after* purchase intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Detect Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Too-good-to-be-true model performance.\n",
    "* Validation accuracy much higher than real-world deployment.\n",
    "* Suspicious features that seem too correlated with the target.\n",
    "* Leakage found in **feature importance** analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Prevent Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split first, preprocess later**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Do train/test split before scaling, imputing, or feature selection.\n",
    "2. **Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use sklearn `Pipeline` to ensure preprocessing happens separately for train/test.\n",
    "3. **Audit features**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Check: *Would I have this feature at prediction time?*\n",
    "4. **Careful with time-series**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Always split chronologically, not randomly.\n",
    "5. **Cross-validation grouping**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Ensure related samples (same patient, same user) are not split across train/test.\n",
    "6. **Domain expertise**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Work with subject experts to identify hidden leakage features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training with leakage = **student cheating with leaked exam answers**.\n",
    "* Deployment = **real exam without leaks** → the student (model) fails badly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:**\n",
    "Data leakage = using future or unavailable information in training.\n",
    "It’s subtle, dangerous, and often the reason behind “amazing models that collapse in production.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Model memorizes noise in training data → poor generalization.\n",
    "* **Example:** Deep tree that perfectly fits training but fails on test.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use **regularization** (L1, L2, dropout).\n",
    "  * Collect more data.\n",
    "  * Use **cross-validation**.\n",
    "  * Prune complexity (e.g., max depth in decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Model too simple → misses important patterns.\n",
    "* **Example:** Using linear regression on complex nonlinear data.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use more expressive models.\n",
    "  * Add features or polynomial terms.\n",
    "  * Reduce regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Class Imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** One class dominates (e.g., 99% normal, 1% fraud).\n",
    "* **Example:** Classifier predicts “normal” always → high accuracy but useless.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Resample (oversample minority, undersample majority).\n",
    "  * Use **SMOTE** (synthetic data generation).\n",
    "  * Choose **balanced metrics** (F1, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall).\n",
    "  * Apply **class weights** in algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data Drift & Concept Drift\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Data or relationships change over time.\n",
    "* **Example:** Customer behavior before vs after COVID.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Monitor model performance regularly.\n",
    "  * Retrain periodically.\n",
    "  * Use **online learning** for streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Features highly correlated → unstable coefficients.\n",
    "* **Example:** Predicting salary with both “years of experience” and “months of experience”.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Remove redundant features.\n",
    "  * Use **regularization (Ridge/Lasso)**.\n",
    "  * Apply **PCA** for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** As features grow, data becomes sparse → distance metrics fail.\n",
    "* **Example:** kNN performs poorly in 1000 dimensions.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use **feature selection**.\n",
    "  * Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).\n",
    "  * Gather more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Sampling Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Training data doesn’t represent real-world distribution.\n",
    "* **Example:** Training only on urban customers → fails on rural customers.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Ensure **stratified sampling**.\n",
    "  * Collect **representative datasets**.\n",
    "  * Be cautious with web-scraped or convenience samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Scaling & Normalization Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Using features with different scales can mislead algorithms.\n",
    "* **Example:** kNN treating “income (\\$)” as more important than “age (years)”.\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Normalize/standardize features.\n",
    "  * Use pipelines to prevent leakage.\n",
    "  * Choose scale-invariant models if possible (trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Evaluation Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Using the wrong metric for the problem.\n",
    "* **Example:** Accuracy in fraud detection (useless if data is imbalanced).\n",
    "* ✅ **Prevention:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Choose metrics suited to task (F1 for imbalance, RMSE for regression).\n",
    "  * Use **cross-validation**.\n",
    "  * Avoid test set reuse (keep a final hold-out set).\n"
