    "Machine Learning is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on teaching computers to **learn patterns from data** and **make predictions or decisions** without being explicitly programmed with fixed rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, we provide **examples (data)**, and the algorithm learns the hidden relationships.\n",

    "## Example to Understand ML\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn from labeled data (input + correct output given).\n",
    "   * Task: Prediction.\n",
    "   * Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Regression (predict numbers, e.g., house prices).\n",
    "     * Classification (predict categories, e.g., spam vs not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn from unlabeled data (only input, no output given).\n",
    "   * Task: Discover patterns.\n",
    "   * Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Clustering (grouping customers by purchase behavior).\n",
    "     * Dimensionality reduction (compressing features for visualization).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Learn by interacting with the environment (trial and error).\n",
    "   * Task: Decision making.\n",
    "   * Example:\n",

    "     * Teaching a robot to walk.\n",

    "## Key Components of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset** â†’ Collection of examples (features + labels).\n",
    "2. **Model** â†’ Mathematical representation that makes predictions.\n",
    "3. **Training** â†’ Process of learning patterns (adjusting model parameters).\n",
    "4. **Evaluation** â†’ Measuring performance (accuracy, error, etc.).\n",
    "5. **Prediction** â†’ Using the trained model on unseen data.\n",

    "## Why is ML important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handles **large, complex data** humans cannot analyze manually.\n",
    "* **Automates tasks** (spam filtering, recommendation systems, fraud detection).\n",
    "* Improves over time as it sees more data.\n",
