    "# DBSCAN\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN = **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise**.\n",
    "It is a clustering algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed and marks points in sparse regions as noise (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of assuming clusters are spherical (like K-Means), DBSCAN finds clusters based on density.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dense regions = clusters.\n",
    "* Sparse regions = noise.\n",
    "* Works well for arbitrary-shaped clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $\\epsilon$ (eps): radius of neighborhood.\n",
    "   * $\\text{minPts}$: minimum number of points required to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Point types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Core point**: has at least `minPts` neighbors within distance $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "   * **Border point**: not a core, but lies within $\\epsilon$ of a core point.\n",
    "   * **Noise point**: neither core nor border.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Density reachability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A point $p$ is **directly density-reachable** from $q$ if $p$ is within $\\epsilon$ of $q$ and $q$ is a core point.\n",
    "   * **Density-connected**: two points are density-connected if there is a chain of density-reachable points linking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick an unvisited point.\n",
    "2. If it is a core point → start a new cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Collect all density-reachable points into this cluster.\n",
    "3. If it is a border point → assign it to a nearby cluster (if possible).\n",
    "4. If it is noise → mark it as outlier.\n",
    "5. Repeat until all points are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Core**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a point $p$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N_\\epsilon(p) = \\{ q \\in D \\ | \\ dist(p,q) \\leq \\epsilon \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $|N_\\epsilon(p)| \\geq \\text{minPts}$, then $p$ is a core point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detects clusters of arbitrary shape.\n",
    "* No need to specify number of clusters (unlike K-Means).\n",
    "* Identifies noise points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sensitive to choice of $\\epsilon$ and `minPts`.\n",
    "* Struggles with clusters of varying densities.\n",
    "* Computationally expensive for large datasets (nearest neighbor queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance metrics for DBSCAN**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since DBSCAN does not optimize a cost function, evaluation uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Silhouette score**: cohesion vs separation.\n",
    "* **Davies–Bouldin index**.\n",
    "* **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** if ground truth labels are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Anomaly detection (fraud, network intrusion).\n",
    "* Spatial/geographical clustering (e.g., earthquake epicenters).\n",
    "* Image segmentation.\n",
    "* Customer segmentation with irregular distributions.\n",
