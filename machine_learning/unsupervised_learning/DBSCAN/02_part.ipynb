    "1. **Core idea**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A cluster is a region where points are packed close together.\n",
    "   * If enough points fall within a small radius ($\\epsilon$), that region is dense → becomes a cluster center.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core points vs noise**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A **core point** has at least `minPts` neighbors within $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "   * Border points lie near cores but don’t have enough neighbors themselves.\n",
    "   * Isolated points with no dense neighbors are labeled noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Growth of clusters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Start from a core point.\n",
    "   * Pull in all points density-reachable from it.\n",
    "   * Expand outward until no more density-connected points exist.\n",
    "   * This process naturally captures arbitrary shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Why it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Dense regions = true structure.\n",
    "   * Sparse regions = separators between clusters.\n",
    "   * Unlike K-Means, DBSCAN does not force spherical shapes or require cluster count in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mental image**:\n",
    "   Imagine pouring ink drops on a scatterplot. Each drop spreads until it thins out. Thick patches form clusters, thin splatters are noise.\n",
