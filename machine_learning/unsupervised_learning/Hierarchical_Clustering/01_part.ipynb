    "## **1.1 Meaningful Distance Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** The distance metric you choose (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine, etc.) **accurately reflects similarity between points**.\n",
    "* **Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If distances do not represent similarity well, the algorithm will merge or split clusters incorrectly.\n",
    "  * Example: Euclidean distance assumes **continuous numerical features** and is sensitive to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.2 Clusters Have a Hierarchical/Nested Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** The data can be meaningfully represented in a **nested, tree-like hierarchy**.\n",
    "* **Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * HC works best if clusters are naturally nested.\n",
    "  * If data has flat clusters with no hierarchy, HC may produce arbitrary splits or merges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.3 Homogeneity Within Clusters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** Points within a cluster are **more similar to each other than to points in other clusters**.\n",
    "* **Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If clusters have very different densities or shapes, some linkage methods (like single or complete linkage) may fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.4 Choice of Linkage Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** The chosen linkage method (single, complete, average, Ward) **appropriately reflects inter-cluster distances**.\n",
    "* **Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Single linkage → can cause “chaining” effect (long, snake-like clusters).\n",
    "  * Complete linkage → favors compact clusters, may break elongated clusters.\n",
    "  * Ward → assumes variance minimization is meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1.5 Scale of Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** Features are **comparable in scale** or have been standardized.\n",
    "* **Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If one feature dominates due to scale, distance metrics (especially Euclidean) will be biased, leading to poor clustering.\n",

    "## **1.6 No Strong Noise or Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** Data is relatively clean; noise and outliers are minimal.\n",
    "* **Implication:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Outliers can create their own singleton clusters or distort dendrogram structure.\n",
