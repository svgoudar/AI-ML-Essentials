    "## NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language (text or speech).\n",
    "It connects **linguistics, computer science, and machine learning** to process natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why NLP is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human communication is mostly through **language** (text, speech, chat, documents).\n",
    "* Computers naturally understand **numbers**.\n",
    "* NLP bridges this gap → converting **language → numerical representations** → machine learning → useful tasks (translation, chatbots, summarization, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Tokenization (splitting text into words/sentences)\n",
    "   * Stopword removal (removing common words like *is, the, and*)\n",
    "   * Stemming / Lemmatization (reducing words to root form)\n",
    "   * Lowercasing, punctuation removal, handling emojis/special chars\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Bag of Words (BoW)\n",
    "   * TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "   * Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)\n",
    "   * Contextual embeddings (ELMo, BERT, GPT, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Language Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Statistical models (n-grams, Markov chains)\n",
    "   * Neural models (RNN, LSTM, GRU)\n",
    "   * Transformer-based models (BERT, GPT, T5, LLaMA, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Core NLP Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Text classification (spam detection, sentiment analysis)\n",
    "   * Named Entity Recognition (NER) (extract names, dates, organizations)\n",
    "   * Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging\n",
    "   * Machine Translation (Google Translate, DeepL)\n",
    "   * Question Answering & Chatbots\n",
    "   * Summarization (extractive, abstractive)\n",
    "   * Text generation (GPT models, story generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Speech-related NLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Speech-to-Text (ASR – Automatic Speech Recognition)\n",
    "   * Text-to-Speech (TTS – Siri, Alexa voices)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### NLP Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect & clean text data\n",
    "2. Preprocess (tokenize, normalize, remove noise)\n",
    "3. Convert to numeric vectors (TF-IDF, embeddings)\n",
    "4. Train ML/DL model (e.g., classification, sequence modeling)\n",
    "5. Evaluate (accuracy, F1-score, BLEU score, ROUGE score depending on task)\n",
    "6. Deploy (API, chatbot, search engine, recommendation system, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ambiguity (e.g., “bank” → riverbank or financial bank?)\n",
    "* Sarcasm & irony detection\n",
    "* Multilingual processing\n",
    "* Domain-specific jargon\n",
    "* Low-resource languages (few datasets available)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chatbots & virtual assistants (ChatGPT, Alexa, Siri)\n",
    "* Sentiment analysis (Twitter, reviews)\n",
    "* Document summarization (news, research papers)\n",
    "* Search engines (Google, Bing)\n",
    "* Fraud detection in finance\n",
    "* Healthcare text mining (clinical notes, prescriptions)\n",
