    "**Elastic Net Regression** is a **regularized linear regression** technique that combines the penalties of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lasso (L1)** → drives some coefficients to **zero** (feature selection).\n",
    "* **Ridge (L2)** → shrinks coefficients (handles multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is especially useful when you have **many correlated features**.\n",

    "$$\n",

    "### Why Use Elastic Net?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lasso issue**: If features are highly correlated, it tends to pick one and ignore others → unstable.\n",
    "* **Ridge issue**: Keeps all features but doesn’t perform feature selection.\n",
    "* **Elastic Net**: Combines both strengths →\n",
    "  ✅ Keeps model stable with correlated features.\n",
    "  ✅ Performs feature selection.\n",

    "### Example Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you’re predicting **house price** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `square_feet`\n",
    "* `bedrooms`\n",
    "* `bathrooms`\n",
    "* `location_score`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `square_feet` and `bedrooms` are highly correlated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lasso** may drop `bedrooms` entirely.\n",
    "* **Ridge** will keep both but shrink their weights.\n",
    "* **Elastic Net** → keeps both but controls their weights → better balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pros & Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Handles multicollinearity\n",
    "✅ Performs feature selection\n",
    "✅ Works well when $p > n$ (more features than samples)\n",
    "❌ Needs tuning of two hyperparameters ($\\lambda, \\alpha$)\n"
