    "# **Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Clusters are Spherical (Convex & Isotropic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means assumes that clusters are **round/ball-shaped** in the feature space.\n",
    "* Works well when clusters are circular (2D) or spherical (multi-dimensional).\n",
    "* If clusters are elongated, irregular, or non-linear (like moons or spirals), K-Means performs poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ Works: Height vs Weight (clusters look circular).\n",
    "* ‚ùå Fails: Data shaped like two half-moons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Clusters are of Similar Size (Balanced Clusters)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means assumes that each cluster has a **similar number of points**.\n",
    "* If one cluster is very large and another is very small, K-Means tends to misclassify the smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Example: In customer segmentation, if 95% are young customers and 5% are elderly, K-Means may ‚Äúignore‚Äù the smaller group.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Equal Density**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The algorithm assumes all clusters have **roughly the same variance (density)**.\n",
    "* If one cluster is dense and another is sparse, the centroid updates can become biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Clusters are Linearly Separable**\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means implicitly assumes that clusters can be separated using straight lines (decision boundaries).\n",
    "* It struggles with overlapping clusters or clusters with complex boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Example: It cannot separate spiral-shaped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Euclidean Distance is Meaningful**\n",
    "\n",
    "* K-Means minimizes squared Euclidean distances, so it assumes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Features are on the same **scale** (standardization is important).\n",
    "  * The geometry of the feature space is meaningful.\n",
    "* If features are on very different scales (e.g., income in lakhs vs. age in years), results will be distorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Number of Clusters (K) is Known**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must predefine **K**.\n",
    "* Wrong choice of K leads to poor clustering.\n",
    "* Techniques like **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score** help estimate K.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **No Major Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outliers can **drag centroids** away from the true cluster center.\n",
    "* K-Means assumes the dataset does not contain many extreme outliers.\n",
