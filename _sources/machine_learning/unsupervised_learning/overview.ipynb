    "# **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is a type of **machine learning** where the model is trained on **unlabeled data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike **supervised learning**, there are no predefined **output labels (y)**.\n",
    "* The goal is to **find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships** within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like giving an algorithm a box of puzzle pieces without the picture — it tries to group or organize them in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No labeled data** → input data $X$ only, no output $y$.\n",
    "2. **Discover structure** → algorithm learns similarities, clusters, or lower-dimensional representations.\n",
    "3. **Exploratory** → often used for understanding data before applying supervised methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Group similar data points together.\n",
    "* Example algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **K-Means**\n",
    "  * **Hierarchical Clustering**\n",
    "  * **DBSCAN**\n",
    "* Example use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Customer segmentation in marketing.\n",
    "  * Grouping similar documents/images.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Dimensionality Reduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce number of features while retaining most information.\n",
    "* Example algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**\n",
    "  * **t-SNE**\n",
    "  * **UMAP**\n",
    "* Example use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data visualization (project high-dimensional data into 2D/3D).\n",
    "  * Speeding up training in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Association Rule Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Discover relationships or rules between variables in large datasets.\n",
    "* Example algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Apriori**\n",
    "  * **FP-Growth**\n",
    "* Example use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Market basket analysis (“customers who buy bread also buy butter”).\n",
    "  * Recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Anomaly Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify rare data points that deviate from the norm.\n",
    "* Example algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Isolation Forest**\n",
    "  * **One-Class SVM**\n",
    "* Example use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Fraud detection in banking.\n",
    "  * Fault detection in machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Can work with **unlabeled/unstructured data** (cheaper and abundant).\n",
    "✅ Helps discover **hidden patterns**.\n",
    "✅ Useful for **exploratory analysis** and **feature engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Harder to **evaluate accuracy** (no ground truth labels).\n",
    "❌ Results may be **less interpretable**.\n",
    "❌ Sensitive to **parameter choices** (e.g., number of clusters in K-Means).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you own an **online store**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You don’t have labels like \"high-value customer\" vs. \"low-value customer\".\n",
    "* Using **clustering (unsupervised learning)**, you group customers based on behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Cluster 1: Customers who buy often but spend little.\n",
    "  * Cluster 2: Customers who buy rarely but spend a lot.\n",
    "  * Cluster 3: Customers who buy often and spend a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps you design targeted marketing campaigns without needing labels.\n"
