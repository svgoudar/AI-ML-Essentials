    "# Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Random Forest is Non-Parametric**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-parametric** means it **doesn’t assume a specific form of the relationship** between features and target (no linearity assumption).\n",
    "* It can model **complex nonlinear relationships** naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:** You don’t need to transform features to fit a line or polynomial; trees handle splits automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Key Implicit Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "While RF is flexible, it still makes a few **practical assumptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Observations are Independent**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Forest assumes that **training samples are independent**.\n",
    "* Correlated or time-dependent samples (like time series) may require special handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In stock price prediction, consecutive days are correlated → standard RF may ignore temporal dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Features Should Have Some Predictive Power**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random Forest works best if **at least some features are informative**.\n",
    "* Including completely irrelevant features usually won’t hurt too much because RF selects random subsets, but too many noisy features may reduce performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Data Representativeness**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training data should be **representative of the population** you want to predict.\n",
    "* Bagging (bootstrap sampling) assumes each sample is drawn from the same underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **D. Decision Trees Assume Split Criteria are Meaningful**\n",
    "\n",
    "* RF splits nodes using measures like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy** (classification)\n",
    "  * **Variance reduction / MSE** (regression)\n",
    "* This assumes that **splitting features can actually reduce impurity**.\n",
    "* If all features are weak or unrelated, RF won’t perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. What Random Forest Does NOT Assume**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No linearity:** Can capture nonlinear patterns\n",
    "* **No normality:** Features or target do not need to be normally distributed\n",
    "* **No homoscedasticity:** Variance of errors can vary\n",
    "* **No feature scaling required:** Trees are scale-invariant\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Practical Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* RF is robust to **outliers**, **missing values** (some implementations), and **feature correlations**.\n",
    "* Correlated features reduce the **diversity among trees**, slightly decreasing the benefit of ensembling.\n",
